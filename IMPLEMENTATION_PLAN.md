# Eat-Soon React Native Implementation Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to rebuild the "Eat Soon" application using React Native and Expo, replicating the functionality of the original Flutter application.

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Foundation

This phase focuses on establishing a solid foundation for the application.

- [x] **1. Verify Expo Project Setup:**
    -   Confirm that the initial Expo project is correctly configured to run on both iOS and Android simulators/devices.

- [x] **2. Establish Directory Structure:**
    -   Create a scalable project structure to organize files logically.
    -   `src/screens`: For screen components.
    -   `src/components`: For reusable UI components.
    -   `src/navigation`: For navigation setup (stacks, tabs).
    -   `src/services`: For business logic and API calls (e.g., Firebase).
    -   `src/hooks`: For custom React hooks.
    -   `src/assets`: For images, fonts, and other static assets.
    -   `src/constants`: For theme, colors, and other constants.
    -   `src/store`: For state management.
    -   `src/utils`: For helper functions.


- [x] **3. Install Core Dependencies:**
    -   `@react-navigation/native`
    -   `@react-navigation/native-stack`
    -   `@react-navigation/bottom-tabs`
    -   `firebase`
    -   `expo-font`
    -   `expo-asset`
    -   `@reduxjs/toolkit`
    -   `react-redux`

- [x] **4. Set up Firebase:**
    -   Connect to the existing Firebase project.
    -   Configure Firebase for both Android and iOS in the Expo project by setting up `firebase.js` with the project credentials.
    -   Deploy the `firebase.rules` to Firestore.

- [x] **5. Manage Assets:**
    -   Copy the `Inter` and `Nunito` font families from the Flutter project's assets to `eatsooon/src/assets/fonts`.
    -   Copy essential images, icons, and Lottie animations.

- [x] **6. Define Theme and Styling:**
    -   Create a `theme.js` file in `src/constants` to define the color palette, typography (font sizes, weights), and spacing, based on the original app's theme.

## Phase 2: Authentication

This phase implements the user authentication flow.

- [x] **7. Build Authentication UI:**
    -   Create screens for:
        -   Sign In (with email/password and Google Sign-In).
        -   Sign Up.
        -   Forgot Password.

- [x] **8. Implement Firebase Authentication:**
    -   Set up Firebase Authentication for email/password and Google Sign-In.
    -   Create services to handle user registration, login, and sign-out.

- [x] **9. Create Authentication Flow:**
    -   Implement a navigation flow that directs users to the main app if authenticated, or to the login screen if not. This will act as the `AuthWrapper`.

## Phase 3: Core Application Features

This phase builds the main functionalities of the app.

- [ ] **10. Set up Main Navigation:**
    -   Implement a bottom tab navigator for the primary sections of the app (e.g., Home, Add Product, Profile, Families).

- [ ] **11. Build the Home Screen:**
    -   Design the UI for the main dashboard, which will display the user's personal product inventory.

- [ ] **12. Implement Firestore Integration for Inventory:**
    -   Define the database schema for the user's personal inventory (`inventory/{userId}/items/{itemId}`).
    -   Create services to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on inventory items in Firestore.

- [ ] **13. Implement Product Scanning:**
    -   Integrate `expo-barcode-scanner` for scanning product barcodes.
    -   Research and integrate a text recognition solution to scan expiration dates from images.

- [ ] **14. Create Add/Edit Product Form:**
    -   Build a form for users to manually add or edit product details (name, expiration date, quantity, etc.).

- [ ] **15. Integrate Camera and Image Picker:**
    -   Use `expo-camera` to allow users to take photos of their products.
    -   Use `expo-image-picker` to allow users to select images from their gallery.

## Phase 4: Family System

This phase focuses on building the collaborative features of the app.

- [ ] **17. Build Family Management UI:**
    -   Create screens for:
        -   Creating a new family.
        -   Viewing family members.
        -   Inviting new members.
        -   Managing family settings (for admins).

- [ ] **18. Implement Family Firestore Logic:**
    -   Create services to handle:
        -   Creating families (`families` collection).
        -   Managing family members (`familyMembers` collection).
        -   Sending, accepting, and declining invitations (`familyInvitations` collection).

- [ ] **19. Implement Family Activity Feed:**
    -   Create a screen to display the shared activity feed for a family.
    -   Implement the logic to post and read activities from the `families/{familyId}/activities` subcollection.

- [ ] **20. Handle Family Switching (if applicable):**
    -   If users can be part of multiple families, implement UI for them to switch between active families.

## Phase 5: Notifications & Background Tasks

This phase adds the sophisticated reminder system.

- [ ] **21. Implement Notification Service:**
    -   Create a service to manage local notifications using `expo-notifications`.
    -   This service will handle requesting permissions and showing alerts.

- [ ] **22. Implement Firestore for Alert State:**
    -   Create a service to interact with the `users/{userId}/alerts` subcollection in Firestore.
    -   This will be used to save a history of notifications and manage their `read` and `visible` state, ensuring consistency across app sessions.

- [ ] **23. Implement Background Task for Notifications:**
    -   Use `expo-task-manager` to register a periodic background task that runs once or twice daily.
    -   This task will fetch the user's inventory, determine which items are expiring soon, and reconcile the notificationsâ€”showing new ones and hiding obsolete ones by updating their state in Firestore via the Alert Service.

- [ ] **24. Configure Push Notifications (for Family System):**
    -   Set up Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to enable push notifications specifically for family invitations and other social interactions, as the expiration alerts are handled locally.

## Phase 6: Finalization and Polish

This phase focuses on improving the user experience and preparing the app for release.

- [ ] **25. Add UI Polish:**
    -   Implement loading indicators (e.g., shimmer effects).
    -   Create user-friendly empty states and error messages.

- [ ] **26. Implement Localization:**
    -   Integrate a library like `i18next` to support multiple languages.

- [ ] **27. Handle Permissions:**
    -   Use Expo's permission APIs to gracefully request permissions for camera, notifications, and image library access.

- [ ] **28. Conduct Thorough Testing:**
    -   Perform comprehensive testing on both physical iOS and Android devices to ensure a consistent and bug-free experience.
